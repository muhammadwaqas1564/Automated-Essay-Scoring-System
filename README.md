# Automated-Essay-Scoring-System
Automated machine learning-based essay grading system ensuring fair, efficient, and scalable evaluation.


Overview
This project focuses on building an Automated Essay Scoring (AES) system that employs machine learning to evaluate student essays. It enhances grading efficiency, ensures fairness, and provides real-time feedback.

Key Features
  1. Essay Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation removal, and text cleaning.
  2. Feature Extraction: Analyzing grammar, coherence, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and readability.
  3. Automated Scoring: Machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM) predict scores based on extracted features.

Technical Components
  1. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy
  2. Model: Random Forest Classifier
  3. Dataset: Labeled essays for training and evaluation

Workflow
  1. Data Input: Users submit an essay.
  2. Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, and text cleaning.
  3. Feature Extraction: Extract key linguistic and content features.
  4. Scoring Model: Predicts an essay score (1-5).
  5. Output: Returns a numerical score with optional feedback.

Potential Applications
  1. Education: Automating essay grading in schools/universities.
  2. E-learning: Instant feedback for online courses.
  3. Content Writing: Evaluating readability and coherence of articles.

Key Innovations
  1. Fair & Unbiased Grading: Eliminates human errors and inconsistencies.
  2. Efficient Feedback: Provides both scores and qualitative suggestions for improvement.
